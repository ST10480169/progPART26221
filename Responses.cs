Attackers craft convincing emails, SMS messages (smishing), or phone calls (vishing) to trick you.\n\n🚨 Warning signs:\n• Unexpected emails about account problems\n• Requests for passwords, OTPs, or banking details\n• Mismatched sender addresses (e.g., support@paypa1.com)\n• Suspicious shortened URLs (bit.ly links in emails)\n\n🛡 Defence tactics:\n• Enable email two-factor authentication\n• Report phishing emails to your IT department or abuse@[provider]\n• Use Google's Phishing Quiz to sharpen your skills\n• Install anti-phishing extensions like Bitdefender TrafficLight",

            "🎣 PHISHING DEEP DIVE\n\nTypes of phishing to know:\n\n📧 Email Phishing — bulk fake emails to millions of users\n🐋 Whaling — targeted attacks on executives or high-value targets\n📱 Smishing — phishing via SMS ('Your delivery failed, click here')\n📞 Vishing — phone call impersonation ('This is Microsoft Support...')\n💼 Spear Phishing — personalised attacks using your real details\n\n✅ Golden Rules:\n• Slow down — urgency is a manipulation tactic\n• Verify via a separate channel before acting\n• Your bank will NEVER ask for your PIN or OTP\n• When in doubt, don't click — report it instead"
